## The BL3 Proton Problem
  BL3, a next generation neutron lifetime experiment, will be the most advanced beam lifetime experiment to date. The experiment seeks to measure the neutron lifetime to unprecedented
uncertainty, and potentially uncover BSM physics by explaining the neutron lifetime problem. A core component of this experiment is the proton trap used to store the remnants of decayed 
neutrons. This trap relies on electrodes and a magnetic field to contain the protons. Periodically, they be absorbed by the electrodes. The rate at which protons are absorbed by the 
electrodes is presently unknown, and this project seeks to quantify this rate.
